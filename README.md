#### Development and Automate Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Data

-   I created an service for:-

    `-   Get SEO data from API.`
    `-   Set Canonical URL for pages.`
    `-   Set SEO data for pages.`

-   I created an interface for data coming from the API.

-   I created two components and routes to set up the SEO data testing.

    `1. Get SEO data from API.`
    `2. Set Canonical URL for this Route.`
    `3. Set SEO data for [title, keywords, description, robots and ect...]`

-   Installed and configured the ngx-sitemap package to generate a sitemap.xml file.

#### How to regenerate XML sitemap

```sh
npm run build
```

###### This command will build the project and make a sitemap.

##### OR

```sh
npm run postbuild
```

###### This command will generate the sitemap if you have a dist folder of the App.

#### Dependencies
